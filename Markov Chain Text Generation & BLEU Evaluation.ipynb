    "# Text Generation with Variations of Markov Chains and Evaluating Text Quality with BLEU Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "This project is presented as a story, starting with text generation using a simple Markov Chain and evaluating its quality. The evaluation is performed by comparing the generated text to a reference text using **BLEU scores**. BLEU is a widely used metric for assessing the quality of machine-generated text, measuring its similarity to a reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Progression of Methods\n",
    "After reviewing the initial BLEU scores, I will aim to improve the scores through transformations of the Markov Chain approach. The steps include:\n",
    "1. **First Markov Chain:**\n",
    "2. **First Markov Chain with a Fallback Method:** .\n",
    "3. **Second Markov Chain:** Enhancing the model with improved n-gram handling.\n",
    "4. **Second Markov Chain with a Fallback Method:**\n",
    "5. **Weighted Random Selection:** Incorporating weighted probabilities, with **fallbacks to bigrams and unigrams**.\n",
    "6. **Final Version:** Eliminating the fallback to unigrams and instead selecting words from the reference text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Results\n",
    "This project is intended as a demonstration of various text generation and evaluation techniques, rather than a showcase of high-quality generated text. The results are naturally limited by the simplicity of the methods and the relatively small dataset used, especially when compared to the extensive datasets and advanced architectures of modern large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Consequently, the generated text is not expected to match the fluency or coherence of those models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "The text data used in this project comprises all available books from the *Anne of Green Gables* series by Lucy Maud Montgomery, downloaded from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/). Project Gutenberg is an online library of free eBooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The books were combined into a single TXT file. Since this project is developed on the Databricks platform, the file was converted into a table within the Databricks Catalog.\n",

    "“So you had tea at the stone house with Lavendar Lewis?” said Marilla at the breakfast table next morning. “What is she like now? It’s over fifteen years since I saw her last . . . it was one Sunday in Grafton church. I suppose she has changed a great deal. Davy Keith, when you want something you can’t reach, ask to have it passed and don’t spread yourself over the table in that fashion. Did you ever see Paul Irving doing that when he was here to meals?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“But Paul’s arms are longer’n mine,” brumbled Davy. “They’ve had eleven years to grow and mine’ve only had seven. ‘Sides, I did ask, but you and Anne was so busy talking you didn’t pay any ‘tention. ‘Sides, Paul’s never been here to any meal escept tea, and it’s easier to be p’lite at tea than at breakfast. You ain’t half as hungry. It’s an awful long while between supper and breakfast. Now, Anne, that spoonful ain’t any bigger than it was last year and I’m ever so much bigger.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Of course, I don’t know what Miss Lavendar used to look like but I don’t fancy somehow that she has changed a great deal,” said Anne, after she had helped Davy to maple syrup, giving him two spoonfuls to pacify him. “Her hair is snow-white but her face is fresh and almost girlish, and she has the sweetest brown eyes . . . such a pretty shade of wood-brown with little golden glints in them . . . and her voice makes you think of white satin and tinkling water and fairy bells all mixed up together.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“She was reckoned a great beauty when she was a girl,” said Marilla. “I never knew her very well but I liked her as far as I did know her. Some folks thought her peculiar even then. Davy, if ever I catch you at such a trick again you’ll be made to wait for your meals till everyone else is done, like the French.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Most conversations between Anne and Marilla in the presence of the twins, were punctuated by these rebukes Davy-ward. In this instance, Davy, sad to relate, not being able to scoop up the last drops of his syrup with his spoon, had solved the difficulty by lifting his plate in both hands and applying his small pink tongue to it. Anne looked at him with such horrified eyes that the little sinner turned red and said, half shamefacedly, half defiantly,\n",
    "\n",
    "“There ain’t any wasted that way.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“People who are different from other people are always called peculiar,” said Anne. “And Miss Lavendar is certainly different, though it’s hard to say just where the difference comes in. Perhaps it is because she is one of those people who never grow old.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“One might as well grow old when all your generation do,” said Marilla, rather reckless of her pronouns. “If you don’t, you don’t fit in anywhere. Far as I can learn Lavendar Lewis has just dropped out of everything. She’s lived in that out of the way place until everybody has forgotten her. That stone house is one of the oldest on the Island. Old Mr. Lewis built it eighty years ago when he came out from England. Davy, stop joggling Dora’s elbow. Oh, I saw you! You needn’t try to look innocent. What does make you behave so this morning?”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Maybe I got out of the wrong side of the bed,” suggested Davy. “Milty Boulter says if you do that things are bound to go wrong with you all day. His grandmother told him. But which is the right side? And what are you to do when your bed’s against the wall? I want to know.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ve always wondered what went wrong between Stephen Irving and Lavendar Lewis,” continued Marilla, ignoring Davy. “They were certainly engaged twenty-five years ago and then all at once it was broken off. I don’t know what the trouble was but it must have been something terrible, for he went away to the States and never come home since.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Perhaps it was nothing very dreadful after all. I think the little things in life often make more trouble than the big things,” said Anne, with one of those flashes of insight which experience could not have bettered. “Marilla, please don’t say anything about my being at Miss Lavendar’s to Mrs. Lynde. She’d be sure to ask a hundred questions and somehow I wouldn’t like it . . . nor Miss Lavendar either if she knew, I feel sure.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I daresay Rachel would be curious,” admitted Marilla, “though she hasn’t as much time as she used to have for looking after other people’s affairs. She’s tied home now on account of Thomas; and she’s feeling pretty downhearted, for I think she’s beginning to lose hope of his ever getting better. Rachel will be left pretty lonely if anything happens to him, with all her children settled out west, except Eliza in town; and she doesn’t like her husband.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Marilla’s pronouns slandered Eliza, who was very fond of her husband.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Rachel says if he’d only brace up and exert his will power he’d get better. But what is the use of asking a jellyfish to sit up straight?” continued Marilla. “Thomas Lynde never had any will power to exert. His mother ruled him till he married and then Rachel carried it on. It’s a wonder he dared to get sick without asking her permission. But there, I shouldn’t talk so. Rachel has been a good wife to him. He’d never have amounted to anything without her, that’s certain. He was born to be ruled; and it’s well he fell into the hands of a clever, capable manager like Rachel. He didn’t mind her way. It saved him the bother of ever making up his own mind about anything. Davy, do stop squirming like an eel.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ve nothing else to do,” protested Davy. “I can’t eat any more, and it’s no fun watching you and Anne eat.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“Well, you and Dora go out and give the hens their wheat,” said Marilla. “And don’t you try to pull any more feathers out of the white rooster’s tail either.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I wanted some feathers for an Injun headdress,” said Davy sulkily. “Milty Boulter has a dandy one, made out of the feathers his mother give him when she killed their old white gobbler. You might let me have some. That rooster’s got ever so many more’n he wants.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“You may have the old feather duster in the garret,” said Anne, “and I’ll dye them green and red and yellow for you.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“You do spoil that boy dreadfully,” said Marilla, when Davy, with a radiant face, had followed prim Dora out. Marilla’s education had made great strides in the past six years; but she had not yet been able to rid herself of the idea that it was very bad for a child to have too many of its wishes indulged.\n",
    "\n",
    "“All the boys of his class have Indian headdresses, and Davy wants one too,” said Anne. “I know how it feels . . . I’ll never forget how I used to long for puffed sleeves when all the other girls had them. And Davy isn’t being spoiled. He is improving every day. Think what a difference there is in him since he came here a year ago.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He certainly doesn’t get into as much mischief since he began to go to school,” acknowledged Marilla. “I suppose he works off the tendency with the other boys. But it’s a wonder to me we haven’t heard from Richard Keith before this. Never a word since last May.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“I’ll be afraid to hear from him,” sighed Anne, beginning to clear away the dishes. “If a letter should come I’d dread opening it, for fear it would tell us to send the twins to him.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A month later a letter did come. But it was not from Richard Keith. A friend of his wrote to say that Richard Keith had died of consumption a fortnight previously. The writer of the letter was the executor of his will and by that will the sum of two thousand dollars was left to Miss Marilla Cuthbert in trust for David and Dora Keith until they came of age or married. In the meantime the interest was to be used for their maintenance.\n",
    "\n",
    "“It seems dreadful to be glad of anything in connection with a death,” said Anne soberly. “I’m sorry for poor Mr. Keith; but I am glad that we can keep the twins.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“It’s a very good thing about the money,” said Marilla practically. “I wanted to keep them but I really didn’t see how I could afford to do it, especially when they grew older. The rent of the farm doesn’t do any more than keep the house and I was bound that not a cent of your money should be spent on them. You do far too much for them as it is. Dora didn’t need that new hat you bought her any more than a cat needs two tails. But now the way is made clear and they are provided for.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Davy and Dora were delighted when they heard that they were to live at Green Gables, “for good.” The death of an uncle whom they had never seen could not weigh a moment in the balance against that. But Dora had one misgiving.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Was Uncle Richard buried?” she whispered to Anne.\n",
    "\n",
    "“Yes, dear, of course.”\n",
    "\n",
    "“He . . . he . . . isn’t like Mirabel Cotton’s uncle, is he?” in a still more agitated whisper. “He won’t walk about houses after being buried, will he, Anne?”\n",

sitting room she had dreamed they will spend the time you don’t come half often enough on my head against your knee that’s the first time he comes and i have two delightful old china had explored spencervale, and, getting word of judgment and comparison not that i made allowances for her will be left at the open door to see them as a fat woman who has been it’s been preying on my lap i won’t be the neighbor whom anne had made a pudding that was unfortunately true it seems that he is my dress is a reduced gentlewoman, explained miss barry gave diana currant wine instead of wakening him up in the parlor is tiny and neat and pretty i made up her mouth was sweet with the most interesting, is to yearn desperately one hour for something i feel that way last winter and spending so much nicer than going round by the old lady lloyd looked uncommonly white and green ears those dogs captured anne’s fancy on the future outside the lane, so marilla bought a lovely day but i’m dreadfully far behind anne and diana rowed the delighted twins down the lane, wherein sat mr harrison haul dulse this morning, while the sorrows god sent us brought comfort and strength with them, and she trembled violently who—who could this pale woman with a quite unnecessary proceeding, for green gables she said curtly the the glossy waves of light, a certain weary stork flew over the arched gateway of patty’s place lately the the glossy waves of her shoulder marilla would have made your blood run cold, my dear, wee man picture to yourself this world is getting worse every day we are going to bring up little boys, especially when she came to be doing uncle abe really has predicted a storm for sometime this spring, you understand and forgive he was always sarcastic after any self betrayal the the glossy waves of her cheeks was hectically brilliant besides, she was just thirteen she stayed until marilla came briskly forward as matthew and marilla didn’t think lucinda was not on the kitchen door if ever anything was lacking in manly beauty anne would have given you the china tray but i’m a coward, mistress blythe—i’ve looked an ugly man fancy me coming down the aisle the sunday school, and was staring at matthew the whole effect was quite true overcome by the roots everybody looked at me in mind of somebody i put a spoonful in too, when i’ve finished these exercises i’ll run down by the back porch nobody went near it thank goodness air and music of bird calls and the concluding chapter of accidents the the glossy waves of light, just over the meadow beyond the harbor head in a silence fell a very ladylike girl, miss barry was here this evening besides, davy is developing into a woman like that never go to college, said mrs barry, going in to tell matthew about it, said anne thoughtfully it would be useful in looking after the hall and up to marilla as soon as you can give you a bluenose after all she was wedged in between a stout lady in a hurry to begin with either and you should see it, all draped in white sands with that taste in my life, i openly lost my temper that’s something to this i don’t know that when he heard that you should show more spirit, janet, she went to the graveyard she is very bad combination, anne but i think there are wonderful tidies on the shore lay clean washed after the football match the spring, you know how he had not been such a roll to it—just like a human being that i was in, especially if i don’t want to i was when i was imagining that i never heard before that jonas would ever have ventured near those quilts, for they may be when i’m such an air of one freak she takes terrible spells it keeps on as an unwarranted putting in my big house with groups of two large platefuls of it, and then this queer jealous streak cropped out in a terrible storm i guess you’re all right she asked me not to depend on our way back home as she can, she reflected she looks very cross, and she considered it her pointed freckled face looking as gilbert worked fractions as if he were thinking of it by one on each evening the cat will be dead, said anne, plucking up heart of a grim expression she was really quite unstrung, for the third now i felt sure he listened to it when we are seniors in february and mine oh, marilla, how can you eat when the old track the common, ignorant folks is travelling but he’ll get over that aspect

lonely, eccentric age the the glossy waves of light, just over the way to be done, said aunt jamesina rather severely kittens have to write about, but that was to be a lifelong sorrow but it died grandma says we should be cross with me, mrs douglas is mum she is halting between two opinions and only the geometry exam comes off and leave ’em to starve another time the silence here is me, who never expects to be removed, the dishes if a man’s heart is broken you’ll feel differently about a lady teacher but i saw her, had grown too dark why, it’s only a lad, and i’d like to have a monopoly of temper, is there, mrs blythe, dearie, she said it to be sure, the improvers had decided to give her a present matthew, with beads of perspiration standing on the nose thereof her mirror before she succeeded in making them sit with the others, enjoying the sweetness of forgotten things clung to me i suppose she has something else something ugly and repulsive the the glossy waves of her sight he was a mere passing from one little maiden dream would the painful process go on living you’ll get into as much to laugh good naturedly at phil now, what have you ever seen him his supper as soon as she left the tall, slim girl with the first compliment i have to read much or do any good oh, don’t use that word, lionel hezekiah, what have you back again for history in the rural community of taste and viewpoint were sadly lacking anne’s disapproval of those cowards would tell me all about her and that she had crossed the main road just above my head i’ll be heartily glad when i think i will, mrs doctor, the subjects for conversation would be surprised at you closely you seem more homey everyone in four winds if he knew when i was thankful to make a complete confession—i’ve been sorry ever since leaving queen’s, but his hands were big, trim barns behind it, solemnly fished it up, and i came to the dishcloth then she sighed immediately afterwards the the glossy waves of her doing, clapping her hands shaken vigorously she was amusing herself as with ocean jewels beyond lay the harbor, in the cellar davy accompanied each of them while i go out alone, she said tillie boulter was real glad she did not even the white way of saying it for the vulgar name but the moon and almost every evening now, at patty’s place, removing the spring witch work even in winter days to having his face reddened and he said the old lady would have admitted to mrs allan was awaiting them the best into it was an old maid in millersville now, and grandchildren climbing over him the strength it should be, from something i won’t look matronly but no broom was visible in the barry household until the early breakfast the next winter i’ll miss the new students, learning to know it she had never expected to get money for them miss josephine barry would have been read at your gate that last night that i wouldn’t pester editors with it and the house when the service was over did you touch it said anne mournfully i’m noted for that old ninny to me, said leslie, but i thought anybody who was trying to have you ever noticed, asked anne the trouble in life again she pulled her arm about anne’s frequent visits, and declared she would not be told of him to confess because i was fair staggered, mistress blythe bring master davy down to the waves that were heaping up just now my weary pilgrimage will soon be in avonlea mrs lynde coming here tomorrow, anne the floor in petticoats’ that squelched him, believe me, and i’d be worried if ‘twas my daughter that was certain she doesn’t have to drop out next year, after all, i dare say there’ll be no more really it than\n"

    "\n",
    "####Weighted Random Selection\n",
    "The weight signifies the likelihood or probability of selecting that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How Weights Are Calculated:\n",
    "For each trigram, bigram, or unigram, the weight of a word is determined by its frequency. Specifically:\n",
    "- In a trigram, the weight of a word is the count of its occurrences following the given word pair. For example, if `\"I like\"` is followed by `\"apples\"` 5 times in the text, `\"apples\"` will have a weight of 5.\n",
    "- This principle also applies to bigrams and unigrams, where the weight corresponds to the frequency of the word's occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Words that appear more frequently with a given pair (in trigrams) or word (in unigrams) will have higher weights, making them more likely to be chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fallback:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the trigram pair is not found, the same logic is applied to bigrams.\n",
    "When falling back to unigrams, weights are directly based on word frequencies."

forgive jane for not coming back to this astonishing change pupil still tablecloth sake put in the parlor, where a ladder up to the very thought of which he was a very different from avonlea the others what her feelings hurt it can’t be i want to do it of course, i had to stop quick, she’s better off as viciously as if, somehow, diana had ever been known to the house of dreams and grieves and rejoices and lives becomes inseparably connected with avonlea, and as she was a very wild set of boys, who were carrying gilbert blythe has to eat i know that it was a little boy and when i was reading it at all i know, said captain jim was the rev mr allan had finished his devotions he leaned back in the world and not just as soon as i would understand can’t you walk down to the island the last time i’ll be as dear to marilla’s heart with regard to the scholarship i decided to give a body could answer mrs barry indeed snapped marilla of all fairy tales to the east gable was a kindred spirit to answer the brooch is gone and that was why i had put that down to the sunset but in a stable it didn’t win the thorburn i don’t know what to do it she would have been a tragedy—a tragedy repeated miss cornelia had never seen that look as if she had a very bad temper ann shirley has a beau in avonlea, because he wouldn’t take it, murmured anne i want to be at the glen pond and the water was literally hemmed in by the time i was i’ve been—i may as well do i remember now that i was a thing but then, the woman he should have expected then he stopped for a little girl in the little house was not irreverence, but simply because she was a little too much people are always so new, too no spring is singing in the crisp fields and the next morning that old lady lloyd as she wandered over here as often as she had been a matter of this avenue of pinehursts and elmwolds and cedarcrofts ‘patty’s place,’ if you had to be good and kind and loving people wouldn’t twit me about the time i go to the kitchen to him i know it would be a good two hours for the last time i really think the most beautiful sight in the drive in spite of her spirit was much to me that it was a very different thing, said phil, coming in as when you have to do it all diana crawled up and down your back you’ll die of homesickness ever since i was born that way last winter and she’s never been able to do his work and one was to be a nice baby when she was a very handsome and clever two years older than his bible in one hand on her way of his, 'i’m very sorry that i had been a very sound of flying footsteps on the road and canvassed for subscriptions we got into the sea leslie sat with her hand to the little house she had exclaimed and she is making a brilliant complexion, and a very nice to be a minister, said felix simply had to be a good deal of difference where i was just an ordinary man after me it will be under your feet are clean and new enough to have a good deal of his time for granting her request for the rest of the fact that he had been a good chance what do you think it would be very careful of it, said anne he lifted his cap courteously, but he lives on the table and chatting over all that is why i shouldn’t be hard to be back next fall i imagined how perfectly lovely to be a burden on the floor and on the evening before the kingship of the room what a beautiful dream do you think that a very old fashioned my clothes are, and it is true that she was the right word to me that i did i’d seen her like a man who had been a very expressive face, anne your thoughts rove all over the dashboard grabbing at the time i was a very bad he was a very good teacher but i guess you did care i’ve deceived myself, that’s all there are others to do her sewing, and when i was a dismal failure when i got up and putting her kind old arms about her neck and kissing her wrinkled cheek affectionately you don’t seem to be a good deal about christine as she hemstitched table napkins industriously it’s time you came dancing along the harbor was to be seen on that account in the world he was a little girl not exactly a kindred spirit nothing more to do with the east gable and sat down by the beech—the perfumed ivory of white things, and i am sure i didn’t know him he would have been a very determined man and a little girl she cried, don’t go—don’t go—i’ll marry you—i’ll go anywhere—and i don’t want to go to the end of the old lady lloyd out to the kitchen, for his benefit but a child while i was a nice looking mannie who comes my way knocks them all to leave them there all day that it was a very handsome and clever two years have taught us she is making a good while yet (dv), so i hate skimpy night dresses but one can live with her when she was so greedy i’d sober her up with a sigh of supreme agony she could not be bad and unregenerate was could hardly overrate it if you were so far as i did and i can’t tell you how ashamed boys are of us did i just felt like a man in avonlea and he would never have dared to do i spin, finished philippa but i’ll have to be a stranger and an english earl and yet i want to be a very good subject, of course i do not like a phantom perfume, said owen such houses, must exert an influence which would have been a toothsome addition to society in four winds harbor of nearly a year before they make the best of all, miss shirley, ma’am i’m sure he never knew that it was the only time i got alonzo’s reply this morning and shoveling out the rich tints of her spirit with its old, perfect, sparkling clearness winds countless to marry me when i was a good chance of marriage but mrs spencer to bring him over from olden times asked anne seriously she had never thought of being a very good thing about the woods, and laughing and chattering gaily they did not look at the front door she wore it proudly she was so thorough and sudden on this is my duty to tell you about mr harrison was really a wonder there was a very good to be a good deal about serious subjects now, you know i meant to be a minister say it was really very interesting anyhow if people spoke out their amiable intentions but sloane was reading a book that was why i can’t tell you to sit up and have tea with me, but it doesn’t make any brief and fashionable wedding call she had not been for the first mate was at the door of the preceding evening but nothing can be and hold it in the middle of the whole story in school and kindled the fire, her wrath it was a matter of fact scotch common sense could not so bad about it moreover, when andrew cameron himself of course, but her father, some by her bed mrs murphy says she thinks it is my dear little heart she knew no one living human being that i ought to be married and he took three toads to bed and on the table and turned away from her, without one or two quilting parties, i suppose you have to go to the end of the yard as anne said no more of it but i don’t know what i would let her have her this very minute and i wouldn’t mind having one hat or none at all, said anne, with a rather pessimistic mood she slept the sleep of a girl and she’s never been able to make a necklace for playing elaine leslie mrs gets and solemnly, just said as sarcastic things to love it you know i never can anywhere else he could not have been a tragedy—a tragedy repeated miss cornelia i suppose it will be a crowd of willing victims who hovered around philippa’s conquering march through her tears as she talked and laughed at him, said marilla severely mr bell were not so quickly if it were a nice boy he’s not to do it again he told me to the point of view the operation is a lawyer there he exclaimed in chorus over it before everybody anne’s got plenty of chances for her to school to her feet and hands, anne could not have been so sure\""
